# Music Share
Web application for sharing music tracks written in C# using the asp.net core framework.

Project developed for high school graduation - years 2019-2020

## Run
```C#
cd MusicShare
dotnet watch run
```
After the command shell indicates that the app has started, browse to https://localhost:{port}, where {port} is the random port used.

## Documentation
